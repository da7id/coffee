# coffee project

I like making coffee and I like using various methods to do so. It is hard to keep up with which cup that I've brewed is best because of all the various different variables that go into a cup of coffee, from grinder used, coffee bean, grin size, brew method, to cup size, water temperature, and time gaps between brew and drink. I am making this app to help me keep track of all of that and also to learn Meteor.
